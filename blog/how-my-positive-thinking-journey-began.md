# How my Positive Thinking Journey Began

Welcome to my blog; I decided to start the first post with some background, a definition of inspiration, my goals, and a few inspirational quotes.

### **The Story That Changed My Perspective**

##### A life-changing trip to Wal Mart

January 27th, 2014, also known as the 3rd Monday of the spring semester, I decided to start an inspirational blog.

The next question, why?

After closing the computer labs on that bitterly cold night, I decided to head over to Walmart for some late-night snacks. When Walking in I noticed an elderly lady sitting on the benches inside the doors holding a suitcase, a blanket, and a trash bag full of clothes; but no food.

While grabbing my typical late-night snacks, Ranch BBQ Frito Twist and cranberry juice, I picked up a box of oatmeal cream pies for the lady on the Bench. It wasn't much, but I felt that any amount of help was still helping. Picking up my bags from the register, it was time to try and make this woman's night.

I arrived near the bench only to find two Walmart employees in her place. Feeling my anger starting to boil, I started the conversation with one of the employees who we shall call Jane.

“Did you kick the older lady out that was sitting here?” I asked angrily.

“No sir, she went into the store.” Jane pointed.

“That's a shame...I bought her these when I noticed she didn't have any food with her,” I told her while pulling out the box from the bag.

Jane replied: “I'm sure we'll see her again. I can give it to her for you; she's **been here four days** because the homeless shelters are full and she doesn't have a place to stay. To be able to stay in the store, she must enter and walk around the store every few hours, else we are required to ask her to leave."

##### Reflection

I handed her the food, thanked her, and felt guilty.

I felt guilty because this semester my fraternity brothers and I chose to live in an older house, meaning a very cold house downtown. This winter the weather has been extremely chilly, so complaining had been a norm.

We had our temperature gauge set to 55 degrees, with each of using electric heaters in our room.

After hearing about the lady who had to sit at Wal Mart, I decided then and there that complaining didn't make sense, and instead of that, I wanted to flip the switch from this negative to positive thinking.

My thoughts continued swirling; I decided to focus on starting a blog on my quest to make this positive life change.

### **What is Inspiration?**

Google results: "the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative..."

How can one aspire to inspire without defining inspiration?

By inspiration, I mean to lift one's spirit, support a positive change, making one's day, month, year, or even their life.

I believe it is known that we cannot change a person, but that a person must be the one who changes themselves for the better. We have the opportunity to help by encouraging, supporting, listening, or in other words, INSPIRING them to make that change.

This is what I want to not only learn how to do better but also pass to you, the readers, the knowledge I obtain along the way.

### **What is_ The Journey to Achieve_?**

Throughout my 22 years on Earth, I've been through rough times, like most people, it was the INSPIRING people (which I am so grateful for) that helped me fight through them. 

I encourage you to be that INSPIRING person. It is the people who step up while others step down that make a difference in a friend’s journey. I hope to focus on a few general topics to assist your time to step up.

The Journey to Achieve is **combining the right mindset, principles, and character traits to achieve** in all that you want in your life, furthermore, its adding value by inspiring people you most care about to achieve. 

I hope to diversify my articles to make them entertaining, informational, and applicable in your life today.
