Should you follow your passion to find your dream job? Is passion what drives Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos as they "tap dance" to work every day? Cal Newport, on his quest to find his own passion and career path, decided to find out - documenting his findings in his book *[So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion in The Quest for Work You Love](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6)*.

I have recently been opening my book notes to the blog community for reference if anyone finds themself looking for a detailed summary with quotes. The book has various reviews because the author himself has only experienced an academic career and at times can seem arrogant (in my humble opinion). I still appreciated the different outlook on finding your passion and skills, along with how to find yourself in places that you enjoy going to work every day for. I hope these notes are helpful to you!

*Most content in this blog post is from the book: So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion In The Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport. The below post is just notes I took from the book to help summarize it when I want to reference it later. The notes are not structured, not perfect in grammar, and of course contain a lot of content from the book. I've tried to put in quotation marks direct quotes, but just want to make it clear almost none of the following content is my own. If you enjoy the notes, purchase the book - I believe it's worth the time!*

Let's get started!!
