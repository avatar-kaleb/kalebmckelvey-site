Should you follow your passion to find your dream job? Is passion what drives Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos as they "tap dance" to work every day? Cal Newport, on his quest to find his own passion and career path, decided to find out - documenting his findings in his book *[So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion in The Quest for Work You Love](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6)*.

I have recently been opening my book notes to the blog community for reference if anyone finds themself looking for a detailed summary with quotes. The book has various reviews because the author himself has only experienced an academic career and at times can seem arrogant (in my humble opinion). I still appreciated the different outlook on finding your passion and skills, along with how to find yourself in places that you enjoy going to work every day for. I hope these notes are helpful to you!

*Most content in this blog post is from the book: So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion In The Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport. The below post is just notes I took from the book to help summarize it when I want to reference it later. The notes are not structured, not perfect in grammar, and of course contain a lot of content from the book. I've tried to put in quotation marks direct quotes, but just want to make it clear almost none of the following content is my own. If you enjoy the notes, purchase the book - I believe it's worth the time!*

Let's get started!!

## Introduction

"'Follow your passion' is dangerous advice."

The book starts with a story of Thomas, who believed that zen was his passion and studying at the Zen Mountain Monastery was his dream. When he quit his job and took on his passion by studying at the monastery, he learned one day (1 year in) what was required to be called a Zen practitioner. He day dreamed of this day, expecting happiness and peace at obtaining his goal and his passion, but he realized - nothing really changed. 

"The reality was, nothing had changed. I was exactly the same person, with the same worries and anxieties. It was late on a Sunday afternoon when I came to this realization, and I just started crying"

"Fulfulling his dream to become a full-time Zen practitioner did not magically make his life wonderful" The author uses this to show why the path to happiness is more complex than asking "What should I do with my life"?

The author found himself on his own question to figure out "How do people end up loving what they do" and this book is documenting his findings.

"The things that make a great job great, I discovered, are rare and valuable. If you want them in your working life, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return...you need to be good at something before you can expect a good job."

"Don't follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become...so good they can't ignore you"

Your focus should be on "working right" instead of finding "right work"
