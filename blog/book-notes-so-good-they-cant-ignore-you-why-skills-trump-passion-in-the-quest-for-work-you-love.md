Should you follow your passion to find your dream job? Is passion what drives Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos as they "tap dance" to work every day? Cal Newport, on his quest to find his own passion and career path, decided to find out - documenting his findings in his book *[So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion in The Quest for Work You Love](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6)*.

I have recently been opening my book notes to the blog community for reference if anyone finds themself looking for a detailed summary with quotes. The book has various reviews because the author himself has only experienced an academic career and at times can seem arrogant (in my humble opinion). I still appreciated the different outlook on finding your passion and skills, along with how to find yourself in places that you enjoy going to work every day for. I hope these notes are helpful to you!

*Most content in this blog post is from the book: So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion In The Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport. The below post is just notes I took from the book to help summarize it when I want to reference it later. The notes are not structured, not perfect in grammar, and of course contain a lot of content from the book. I've tried to put in quotation marks direct quotes, but just want to make it clear almost none of the following content is my own. If you enjoy the notes, purchase the book - I believe it's worth the time!*

Let's get started!!

## Introduction

"'Follow your passion' is dangerous advice."

The book starts with a story of Thomas, who believed that zen was his passion and studying at the Zen Mountain Monastery was his dream. When he quit his job and took on his passion by studying at the monastery, he learned one day (1 year in) what was required to be called a Zen practitioner. He day dreamed of this day, expecting happiness and peace at obtaining his goal and his passion, but he realized - nothing really changed. 

"The reality was, nothing had changed. I was exactly the same person, with the same worries and anxieties. It was late on a Sunday afternoon when I came to this realization, and I just started crying"

"Fulfulling his dream to become a full-time Zen practitioner did not magically make his life wonderful" The author uses this to show why the path to happiness is more complex than asking "What should I do with my life"?

The author found himself on his own question to figure out "How do people end up loving what they do" and this book is documenting his findings.

"The things that make a great job great, I discovered, are rare and valuable. If you want them in your working life, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return...you need to be good at something before you can expect a good job."

"Don't follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become...so good they can't ignore you"

Your focus should be on "working right" instead of finding "right work"

## Chapter 1 - The "Passion" of Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs has a famous quote:

> "You've got to find what you love...[T]he only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle.

### The Passion Hypothesis

"The key to occupational happiness is to first figure out what you're passionate about and then find a job that matches this passion."

This is contained within many career and personal dev books...to be happy...you must follow your passion.

"'Follow your passion' might just be terrible advice."

### Do What Steve Jobs Did, Not What He Said

He goes into details of how Steve Jobs studied Western history and dance and dabbled in Eastern mysticism. Further, he dropped out of college and because of that became a celebrity on campus as he slept on couches and received free meals.

Eventually, Wozniak and Jobs were partnered up because Wozniak was great with electronics and handed the business side of things of an arrangement to Jobs. He left to go to an All-One commune without telling the boss, and was replaced.

The author questions at this point: "Does this look like someone passionate about tech?"

Eventually in the same year - Jobs pitched designing a computer circuit board so they could sell them to local hobbyists, leading to a small amount of profit.

They tried selling them to Mountain View computer store, where they were told they didn't want circuit boards but would pay $500 for fully assembled computers....the rest is pretty much history and Apple was born.

It wasn't born because Steve Jobs had passion, but instead wanted to make mula.

"I don't doubt that Jobs eventually grew passionate about his work: If you've watched one of his keynote addresses, you've seen a man who obviously loved what he did. But so what? All that tells us is that it's good to enjoy what you do...but it doesn't help us answer: How do we find work that we'll eventually love?"

## Chapter 2 - Passion is Rare

This chapter talks through a show called Roadtrip Nation that interviewed successful people throughout the nation.

> Al Merrick...tells a similar tale of stumbling into passion over time. "People are in a rush to start their lives, and it's sad...I didn't go out with the idea of making a big empire...I set goals for myself at being the best I could be at whatever I could."

***Key: Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion"***

### The Science of Passion

Three conclusions from the author:

1. *Career Passions Are Rare* - he quotes a study where the hobbies of people were not marketable / income generating
1. *Passion Takes Time* - "A job...is a way to pay bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work, and a calling is work that's an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity"
1. *Passion is a Side Effect of Mastery* - Three requirements of a job to keep people motivated. Autonomy, the feeling you have control over your day and your actions are important. Competence, feeling you are good at what you do. Relatedness, the feeling of connection to other people.

"The reason that more experienced assistances enjoyed their work was because it takes time to build the competence and autonomy that generates this enjoyment.

Competence and autonomy are achievable by most ppl, neither require passion
