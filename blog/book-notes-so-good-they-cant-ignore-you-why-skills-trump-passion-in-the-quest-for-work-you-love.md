Should you follow your passion to find your dream job? Is passion what drives Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos as they "tap dance" to work every day? Cal Newport, on his quest to find his own passion and career path, decided to find out - documenting his findings in his book *[So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion in The Quest for Work You Love](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6)*.

I have recently been opening my book notes to the blog community for reference if anyone finds themself looking for a detailed summary with quotes. The book has various reviews because the author himself has only experienced an academic career and at times can seem arrogant (in my humble opinion). I still appreciated the different outlook on finding your passion and skills, along with how to find yourself in places that you enjoy going to work every day for. I hope these notes are helpful to you!

*Most content in this blog post is from the book: So Good They Can't Ignore You - Why Skills Trump Passion In The Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport. The below post is just notes I took from the book to help summarize it when I want to reference it later. The notes are not structured, not perfect in grammar, and of course contain a lot of content from the book. I've tried to put in quotation marks direct quotes, but just want to make it clear almost none of the following content is my own. If you enjoy the notes, purchase the book - I believe it's worth the time!*

Let's get started!!

## Introduction

"'Follow your passion' is dangerous advice."

The book starts with a story of Thomas, who believed that zen was his passion and studying at the Zen Mountain Monastery was his dream. When he quit his job and took on his passion by studying at the monastery, he learned one day (1 year in) what was required to be called a Zen practitioner. He day dreamed of this day, expecting happiness and peace at obtaining his goal and his passion, but he realized - nothing really changed. 

"The reality was, nothing had changed. I was exactly the same person, with the same worries and anxieties. It was late on a Sunday afternoon when I came to this realization, and I just started crying"

"Fulfulling his dream to become a full-time Zen practitioner did not magically make his life wonderful" The author uses this to show why the path to happiness is more complex than asking "What should I do with my life"?

The author found himself on his own question to figure out "How do people end up loving what they do" and this book is documenting his findings.

"The things that make a great job great, I discovered, are rare and valuable. If you want them in your working life, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return...you need to be good at something before you can expect a good job."

"Don't follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become...so good they can't ignore you"

Your focus should be on "working right" instead of finding "right work"

## Chapter 1 - The "Passion" of Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs has a famous quote:

> "You've got to find what you love...[T]he only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle.

### The Passion Hypothesis

"The key to occupational happiness is to first figure out what you're passionate about and then find a job that matches this passion."

This is contained within many career and personal dev books...to be happy...you must follow your passion.

"'Follow your passion' might just be terrible advice."

### Do What Steve Jobs Did, Not What He Said

He goes into details of how Steve Jobs studied Western history and dance and dabbled in Eastern mysticism. Further, he dropped out of college and because of that became a celebrity on campus as he slept on couches and received free meals.

Eventually, Wozniak and Jobs were partnered up because Wozniak was great with electronics and handed the business side of things of an arrangement to Jobs. He left to go to an All-One commune without telling the boss, and was replaced.

The author questions at this point: "Does this look like someone passionate about tech?"

Eventually in the same year - Jobs pitched designing a computer circuit board so they could sell them to local hobbyists, leading to a small amount of profit.

They tried selling them to Mountain View computer store, where they were told they didn't want circuit boards but would pay $500 for fully assembled computers....the rest is pretty much history and Apple was born.

It wasn't born because Steve Jobs had passion, but instead wanted to make mula.

"I don't doubt that Jobs eventually grew passionate about his work: If you've watched one of his keynote addresses, you've seen a man who obviously loved what he did. But so what? All that tells us is that it's good to enjoy what you do...but it doesn't help us answer: How do we find work that we'll eventually love?"

## Chapter 2 - Passion is Rare

This chapter talks through a show called Roadtrip Nation that interviewed successful people throughout the nation.

> Al Merrick...tells a similar tale of stumbling into passion over time. "People are in a rush to start their lives, and it's sad...I didn't go out with the idea of making a big empire...I set goals for myself at being the best I could be at whatever I could."

***Key: Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion"***

### The Science of Passion

Three conclusions from the author:

1. *Career Passions Are Rare* - he quotes a study where the hobbies of people were not marketable / income generating
1. *Passion Takes Time* - "A job...is a way to pay bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work, and a calling is work that's an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity"
1. *Passion is a Side Effect of Mastery* - Three requirements of a job to keep people motivated. Autonomy, the feeling you have control over your day and your actions are important. Competence, feeling you are good at what you do. Relatedness, the feeling of connection to other people.

"The reason that more experienced assistances enjoyed their work was because it takes time to build the competence and autonomy that generates this enjoyment.

Competence and autonomy are achievable by most ppl, neither require passion

## Chapter 3 - Passion is Dangerous 

### The Birth of the Passion Hypothesis

Cal Newport gives credit to the 1970 publication "What Color is Your Parachute" by Richard Bolles for the idea to follow your passion. The younger generations "...expect work to be not just a job but an adventure...a venue for self-development and self- expression...and something that provides a satisfying fit with their assessment of their talents."

The more Cal studied the issue, he began seeing trends that finding the "magic right job" causes people to job hop and fail to find the job they want, because then they never are competent enough at one job (since his hypothesis is that you find your passion in a job you know how to do).

## Rule #2 Be So Good They Can't Ignore You (Or, the Importance of Skill)

## Chapter 4 - The Clarity of Craftsman

Two mindsets:
1. Craftsman Mindset - "Focus on what value you're producing in your job"
1. Passion Mindset - "Focus on what value your job offers you"

Most people have the passion mindset, but he believes that the craftsman mindset is the way to go.

Steve Martin said: "Be so good they can't ignore you."

"If somebody's thinking, 'How can I be really good?' people are going to come to you"

"Stop focusing on these little details, focus instead on becoming better"

He recommends tracking your hours to things you want to become better at, by actually tracking it, you will see how much effort you actually are putting forth.

Studio musicians have this adage: "The tape doesn;t lie"

If you're not focusing on becoming so good they can't ignore you, you're going to be left behind.

The craftsman mindset focuses on ***What you can offer the world*** 

He notes a second issue with the passion mindset is that it can be very difficult to answer: "What do I truly love doing or Who Am I?"

He uses Steve Martin and Jordan Tice as examples of craftsman mindset people.

## Chapter 5 - The Power of Career Capital

Career capital is created with the craftsman mindset, where he says if you want a great job, you need to build up rare and valuable skills (career capital).

### Traits That Define Great Work
- Creativity - innovation / pushing boundaries
- Impact - changing the way we live our lives
- Control - Choosing when you work, how you work etc

Having these fundamental traits at your job can be difficult; it isn't easy to change the world in an entry level job.

"The key thing is to force yourself through the world, force the skills to come, that's the hardest phase!"

### The Career Capital Theory of Great Work

- "Traits that define great work are rare and valuable"
- "Supply and demand says if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills"
- With "relentless focus on becoming so good they can't ignore you", you will become very skilled

"The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on what you produce is exactly the mindset you would adopt if your goal was to acquire as much career capital as possible"

To get good things in your work life, you need to be good!

### Three Disqualifiers for Applying the Craftsman Mindset

1. Few opportunities to grow rare skills
1. Job focuses on something that isn't good for the world
1. It forces you to work with people you really dislike

If a job has a combo of these traits, it can "thwart your attempts to build and invest career capital."

## Chapter 6 - The Career Capitalists

"...Mike literally tracks every hour of his day, down to quarter-hour increments, on a spreadheet. He wants to ensure his attention is focused on the activities that matter."

## Chapter 7 - Becoming a Craftsman

Deliberate practice is the key strategy for acquiring career capital

"...the difference in our abilities by the age of eighteen had less to do with the number of hours we practiced...and more to do with what we did with those hours."

"Watching Jordan's current practice regime, these traits - strain and feedback -  remain central...he keeps adjusting the speed of his practicing to a point just past where he's comfortable. When he hits a wrong note, he immediately stops and starts over, providing instant feedback for himself."

"The difference in strategy that separates average guitar players like me from starts like Tice and Casstevens is not confined to music." 

Focus on stretching your abilities and getting feedback - aka deliberate practice!

Deliberate Practice - "activity designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual's performance."

"If you just show up and work hard, you'll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better."

***Most types of work don't have a deliberate practice or training routine...if you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice...you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your values.***

### The Five Habits of Craftsman

1. Decide What Capital Market You're In
   - Winner takes all - only one type of career capital that everyone are competing for
   - Auction - Many types and everyone generates their own collection
1. Identify Your Capital Type
   - Once you identify, define skills to build
1. Define "Good" 
   - define the deliberate practice to reach good with clear goals
1. Stretch and Destroy
   - Push you past the plateau and into a realm of no competition
   - "Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable"
   - If you're not uncomfortable, then you're probably stuck at an "acceptable level"
   - Embrace feedback so you can destroy acceptable and push to great/good!

1. Be Patient
   - "...Martin redefined [diligence] so that it's less about paying attention to your main pursuit, and more about your willingness to ignore other pursuits that pop up along the way to distract you.

The idea is continually stretch yourself overtime to get to the point people begin noticing!

## Rule #3 - Turn Down a Promotion

## Chapter 8 - The Dream-Job Elixer

Control over what you do and how you do it is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating work you love.

"You have to get good before you can expect good work"

"...farming is a complicated and stressful pursuit - but their lives are their own to direct, and they're good at this...the weather is something to battle, not to enjoy. And it's not about getting away from the computer screen...instead, autonomy that attracts the Granby groupies: Ryan and Sarah live a meaningful life on their own terms"

### The Power of Control

"...control has been found to improve people's lives....more control leads to better grades, better sports performance, better productivity, and more happiness.

"Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.

## Chapter 9 - The First Control Trap

"it's dangerous to pursue more control in your working life before you have career capital to offer in exchange"

### First Control Trap

"Control acquired without career capital is not sustainable."

He gives example of some bloggers assume that generated the courage to pursue control is what matters, but quickly realize that the details for doing so should be thought through first.

## Chapter 10 - The Second Control Trap

"The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you've become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change"

This chapter talks through a few examples of how different people navigated getting more control and fought through the resistance by the company to do so. Even some of them had to fight through critics in their inner circle who thought they were making a big mistake by turning down job offers or promotions.

The reason this makes sense is because the more control you want that benefits you might not directly benefit the company. 

The key is knowing when to make courageous career decisions, because it makes all the difference in how that control works out. Once you have career capital, it can be much easier to gain more control.
