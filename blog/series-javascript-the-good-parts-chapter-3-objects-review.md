Chapter 3 of *JavaScript: The Good Parts* by Douglas Crockford is all about objects. This essential part of the language makes JS special due to the flexibility and quickness one can create data maps, abstractions, and more.

Let's dive in!

## What are Objects in JS?

"Objects in JavaScript are mutable keyed collections."

"An object is a container of properties, where a property has a name and value. A property name can be any string, including the empty string. A property value can be any JavaScript value except for `undefined`."

They are SO useful for creating collections of data and organizing it throughout an web app. They can be nested within each other and since Arrays, Functions, and regular expressions are objects, they too can be contained and mapped efficiently.

Objects can inherit properties from other objects through their prototypes - something we will dive into more deeply later in the article!
