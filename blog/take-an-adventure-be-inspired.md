Today I visited a well-known tower in Cincinnati for a Sunday adventure, because it rained alllllll day Saturday. After being cooped up and switching between Netflix/my computer, it was time for a change. While up on the tower, I met a woman who was eating a sandwich (more on that soon).

She helped me realize two things: first, let other people impact your life (we aren’t alone!), and second, have the courage to do something you never have before.

## Take an adventure...

By taking an adventure, I don’t mean to get your hiking gear on and take a trip.

An adventure can be anything new to get out of the ordinary routines/habits that typically use up our time. The tower view was breathtaking and as I began talking to my new friend, the sandwich lady, who told me the reason behind her visit that day.

## Inspiration from a stranger!

She said that her mother used to work at the tower, and her favorite job was operating the old elevator that took people up to the observation deck.

Each day for lunch, her mom would come and sit where she was standing to eat her lunch at the top of the tower. WOW! I asked her if she had come up to the tower often for her lunch, she said it was her first time. Heights were not one of her ideas of fun.

Not only did this help me have a better time enjoying the view, she even asked me what I was doing there, allowing me to tell her about my family and how much I miss them. She said she often missed her mom and told me stories about her. I let her know how encouraging it was for her to conquer her fear because we all find it difficult to.

She showed me all of the different notable places we could see from the tower (she was a Cincinnatian) and even took the picture you can see below.

It is in moments like these that a picture is truly worth 1,000 words!!

We can all be inspiring, or impact someone’s life in our own way. Next weekend, go somewhere new, take your adventure, meet a stranger, and let them inspire you!!

As always, feel free to leave comments or email me for questions!

Have a great week!!
