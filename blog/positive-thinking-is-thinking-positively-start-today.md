## IChing Quote

My favorite quote to help explain this thing we call positive thinking is from the IChing Wisdom:

“A situation only becomes favorable when one adapts to it.”

## Change your perspective

In other words, change your perspective by looking to adapt instead of dwell on a situation.

Positive thinkers practice optimism by training their brains to see life from this perspective, using every situation as a new way to adapt and become better. They live a happier life because their outlook focuses on realistically changing to improve or solve rather than complicate.

## Realistic positive mindset

Furthermore, what one thinks, becomes what one says. What one says, becomes what one does.  

In other words, positive thinking becomes positive speaking, which in turn becomes positive actions. Positive people shift I can't into I can, complaints into resolutions, and problems into solutions.

The habit of positive thinking, like all habits, takes effort and time to form.  I've listed some of the actions I will be taking to help make this change.

## **Tips for becoming more positive:**

### Take Responsibility

In life, one can only control what they have control of, meaning there are situations, people, problems, and solutions that are dependent on others. A life focused on controlling we have control over, to the best of our ability on what produces much more happiness in our lives. I feel that the most important factors we can control our emotions and thoughts. For us to control either, we must take responsibility by recognizing and changing them. We must focus on the solution, knowing that we are not the victim, but a leader leading ourselves to a better outcome.

### Share Kindness

Google defines kindness as “the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.” In other words, being nice to others.

When was the last time you helped someone not because they asked, but because you wanted to?

When was the last time you volunteered for the community without it needing to meet requirements?

It is the little things that make us that much better in our life. Make it a goal to perform an act of kindness for a friend or stranger regularly. The positive effects can’t be explained; only felt when the action is done.

### Use Mantras

Background information:
<http://www.theyogasanctuary.net/tips-mantras.html>

Mantras are simple and powerful statements used for the daily renewal of one’s character and goals.

I encourage you to create your own instead of using the examples found on the web. I feel that creating your own produces a significant belief in the mantra, which leads to better results.

Examples:

1. "I am a confident and kind person."
2. "I adapt positively to all situations."
3. "I am a positive thinker"

### Remove Excuses

Excuses are tools of the incompetent.

As a positive person, we have goals to accomplish, dreams to achieve, and aspirations to be successful. To make these dreams a reality, we must be competent; to be competent we must not use excuses.  Use the time wasted thinking of excuses  to instead find an alternative solution.

Just because you have mantras doesn't mean you automatically are what they say. They help remind you to grow and continue to become that what you wish to be.
