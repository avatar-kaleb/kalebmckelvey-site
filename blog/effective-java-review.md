# Preface

Learning a new program language is similar to learning a new language, you need to know the language structure or grammar, how to name things or vocab, and how to say them properly or usage. Programming requires to know the core of the language, like is it Object oriented or functional, it's data structures and operations provided in its standard libaries, and how to use them by structuring your code.

"The Java programming language, for example, is object-oriented with single inheritance and supports an imperative (statement-oriented) coding style within each method. The libraries address graphic display support, networking, distributed computing, and security..."

Additionally, programs change over time, so we must be able to easily modify the code by structuring it properly.

You can read: "The Java™ Language Specification by Gosling, Joy, yours truly, and Bracha." for the first two parts of learning the language, this book is for #3.

"I naturally think in terms of exported APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and I encourage you to do likewise. Even if you aren’t developing reusable components, thinking in these terms tends to improve the quality of the software you write. Furthermore, it’s not uncommon to write a reusable component without knowing it: You write something useful, share it with your buddy across the hall, and before long you have half a dozen users."

He notes tihs is different then what's stated in something like _Extreme Programming_ since it would require flexible design for something not created yet.
