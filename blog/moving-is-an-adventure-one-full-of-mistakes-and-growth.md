Glad to be back with a new post for everyone. Since last posting, I’ve graduated from college, started a new job in the Healthcare Industry, and moved to a new state. To say the least, life has had a bit of change. Although the change has been big, the experience has been one full of great moments to reflect and learn from. I already have made some mistakes, aimed way too high, met great people, and dealt with homesickness. I want to share with you how we can reflect on negatives and adapt as [positive thinkers](https://www.kalebmckelvey.com/positive-thinking-is-thinking-positively-start-today) should.

## Mistakes:

Mistakes, mishaps, accidents, misunderstandings, etc. lead us to embarrassments, awkwardness, tension, and self-consciousness.

In other words, making a mistake when meeting a potential friend or when you start a new job can wreak havoc on your confidence, leading you right back into your comfort zone.

I feel that mistakes are growth opportunities.

Yes, I accidentally canceled instead of updating an event in Outlook on the day of an event. Yes, it was embarrassing. Yes, I most likely turned red. And Yes, I tripled checked Outlook when making event changes in the weeks afterward. But most importantly, I learned that mistakes happen, so when they do, handle them with 2 Cs: **composure** and **confidence**.

Stay composed, and communicate as soon as possible that you have made a mistake and you solving it. This shows your confidence as a leader to grow by being the one to take on a new experience, and also that you know how to handle mistakes effectively.

Mistakes happen and that is fine…run with it!

Admit to your mistake, make a new event, invite the right people, communicate challenges and its correction. People will still attend, you will still have fun, and life will still go on :).

## Perfection:

Ever tried to be perfect and failed? I have.

I believe it has been a mistake (yes another mistake) for me over the last month to try to perfect life. Sure it is a great goal to strive for, but doesn't the R in SMART goals stand for realistic?

I know in the past I've tried to be a perfect shooter during a basketball game, write the perfect blog, type the perfect email, or create the perfect meeting invite…do any of these even exist?

I don’t know.

I do know I have yet to reach that perfection. I have reached higher stress levels and less productivity by trying. Emails typically stay the same even if you read it 4 times before sending it. 

I want to use this as an opportunity for us to let these stresses go.

We are not perfect, no worries! I don’t always remember to pack my belt when I head to the gym before work. I don’t always remember my watch either. But I do remember the feeling of disappointment in myself for packing and forgetting. Why would I pack everything the night before, if I was just going to forget something anyway? Ever had to go through a workday without a belt? How could I forget for a second time??

This is how…....we all forget things, we all commit imperfections, and this is OK! I learned to make a list of items to pack for the gym to double-check myself and prevent it from happening in the future. We accept the imperfection without disappointment, we adapt to prevent it in the future, and again our life goes on!

## People:

There are so many different types of people (from our perspective) in our world. Funny, serious, low-key, social, introverted, outgoing, bubbly, boring, extroverted, etc. What I've found the most interesting about moving to a new place is that any type of person can make your day.

Getting an introvert to talk leads to interesting conversations about their hobbies no one knows they have. Lunch cost eight dollars, but meeting a colleague comedian for your daily laughter medicine is priceless!

Trusting someone to mentor you, teach you organization strategies, or give you advice, does not require you to have the same personality type, culture, background, or even have the same first language. There are just so many great people with interesting stories to hear, all we have to do is make the effort to ask and **actively **listen to them.

In the past 5 weeks, I've met people from India, the UK, France, and Israel. I've met very smart people with and without degrees. People who inspire, people who demonstrate great leadership. The list goes on. The melting pot of people has been truly remarkable because without them even knowing it, they have made many of my tough days here into positive ones.

## Home:

Home...22 years of surrounding mountains. Friends and family only hours or minutes away. It is the place one feels comfortable, happy, loved. A place we all eventually have to leave. It is hard. Life is hard sometimes.

The feeling of someone calling to check up on you helps you appreciate your friendship.  Planning a visit to see them shows you truly care even though you’re not there. Moving challenges you and your friends to demonstrate how real of a friendship it is. It is all part of life, and it's the ones that still call you or the ones you make sure to call that make you realize just how lucky you are to have them in your life.

I truly miss and love you all!

## Last remarks:

Moving to a new place can be stressful. It can be hard. And most importantly it can be positive. I hope you found this to be somewhat helpful or inspiring. I've learned inspiring people doesn't mean to inspire everyone, but to try and hope it inspires some.
