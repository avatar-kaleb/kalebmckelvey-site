Happy Thanksgiving!!

I hope everyone enjoyed this gratitude-filled day, gave many thanks for all of their blessings, and are sitting on their couch with a full belly. I had a blast attending a Friendsgiving here in Wisconsin and yes, my belly is full!!

As I’m still here over the break and being off of work, I decided to host a hackathon for myself over the next two days. I plan to reward myself with an Amazon Fire Stick (so I can finally watch Avatar Aang on my TV) if I successfully make a prototype.

Overall this is a very random blog post as a commitment to myself. This will help to hold me accountable over the next 2.5 days.

## What is Kaleb’s Thanksgiving Hackathon?

A hackathon is a dedicated time (usually weekend) where you develop a prototype app to an idea, then present it for prizes and/or funding depending on the type of hackathon.

Seeing as I set a goal to develop an App this year and being that I traveled a bit more than expected, I’m behind schedule. This is my attempt to get back on track while learning along the way.

## When is Kaleb’s Thanksgiving Hackathon?

Starting tomorrow November 25th at noon, I will begin to design and develop my prototype. I will give myself 2 full days, meaning on Sunday at Noon, I will be posting a part 2 to this blog with progress, pictures, and results.

Throughout these two days, I will not sleep much, learn fast, and grub on my some favorite snacks. It is my excuse and way to stay busy while learning new skills over the break.

## How did I prepare for a Thanksgiving Hackathon?

Preparation is key when dedicating yourself for two days straight like this, so here are three things I did: _First_, I decided on what to build and what tech stack I will be using:

* Tech Stack:
  * Ionic 2 – Hybrid app framework using Typescript and Angular 2
  * Database wise – I’ll admit to using stubbed data for the weekend, then integrate a service later
  * Experience – I’ve played around with Ionic and taken a class on Udemy for Angular 2. This is my attempt to learn fast and deliver to meet my goal for MVP 1 this year
* Idea:
  * My InspireMe app – what is that? I hope to show you on Sunday J
* Automatic Text Replies
      * I downloaded an app to text people back and let them know I’m busy, and to call if it’s an emergency.
  _Second_, I bought snacks and food:
* Snacks / Food
      _ Sparkling water
      _ Frito twist ranch barbecue (my favorite snack)
      _ Fruit – bananas, strawberries
      _ Almonds – quick and easy energy
      _ Pancake mix for breakfast
      _ Salads, leftovers, and slow cooker meals for lunch/dinners
      * Coffee and Espresso beans!!
  _Third_, and most important:
* I completed all my house chores (except dishes...who does dishes? JK).
  This will give me peace of mind and help let me focus throughout the hackathon.

## Final thoughts:

LET’s GET READY TO RUMBLE!!!!

Looking forward to showing you what happens in 2.5 days!!! Please leave any questions or comments below.

One Love,

Kaleb McKelvey
