As the first month of the new year ends, I've made the decision to begin making my book notes public so others can potentially benefit from them if they so choose to.

I picked up a new book recently, [How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing with People](https://www.amazon.com/Have-Confidence-Power-Dealing-People/dp/0988727536), which is an interesting read when comparing and contrasting with the principles from the famous [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034).

## The Book Structure

Les Giblin structures the books into six main parts:
1. Making Human Nature Work For You
1. How to Control the Actions and Attitudes of Others
1. Techniques for Making and Keeping Friends
1. How to Manage People Successfully
1. A Simple, Effective Plan of Actions That Will Bring You Success and Happiness

I'll be diving into each part, along with individual chapters to summarize and highlight important points to take away.

Before chapter one starts though, the book shows just what reading this book can do for you.

## What This Book Can Do For You

The introduction demonstrates the honest truth that "we want things from other people. We want other people's good will and friendship. We want their acceptance and recognition...."Every normal human being wants success and happiness"

Part of our happiness and success actually depends on others, because how we interact with them makes a huge difference in our own success. By understanding human nature better and being honest that we need things from others, and they need things from us, we can grow our skillset in finding win-win situations through our interactions with them. Here's a quote that summarize this:

"Let's get one thing straight: successful human relations means giving the other fellow something he wants in return for something you want. Any other method of dealing with people simply doesn't work."

In summary, by understanding that you have skills and assets give in exchange for skills or assets of others, you can find ways to give people what they want or need in exchange for what you want or need. This fair exchange is the best way to dealing with people in a positive way!

The rest of the book will be helping to determine how we can do this better, on the basis of knowing more about human nature and using it confidently.

## Part One - Making Human Nature Work For You

### Chapter 1 - TODO

We all have developed ways for getting along with others, from being aggressive, assertive, passive, or somewhere in between. We go through the world with our mental model without issue, but that doesn't mean it will bring us personal satisfaction and properly manage the ego of those we're dealing with. Both parties should exit with egos intact - that is the key ladies and gentlemen!

When you take a step back and analyze who the most successful people you know are, what traits do you think of? Are they the smartest or most skillful? "...the chances are that you will say that the people you know who are most successful, and enjoy life the most, are those who "have a way" with other people.

**Personality Problems**

When we are shy, timid, extroverted, confident, or bossy - people are just trying to be accepted. They quickly learn though that you can't force friendship or acceptance, and when we try, our emotional health suffers. 

"Bonaro Overstreet,..., says that disruptive emotional problems always have their root in our relations with other people." 

Learning to better engage others helps our emotional health as well as our success!

**Social Skills in Engineers Literally Pays**

Purdue kept records of its Engineer graduates over ~5 years to determine which skills led to higher pay:

"When the earnings of those graduates who had demonstrated a marked ability to deal with others in social situations were compared, it was found that they averaged about 15 percent more than those of the "smart" group, and about 33 percent more than those with low personality rating."

*The study shows personality matter, but I couldn't find the exact study. What social skills did they look for? How did they determine someone's level of social skills? I say this because there are varying levels of social skills and in a world where Extroverts have typically been seen as having social skills, we should not confuse that with specific social skills on the job. Yes extroverts may be more social, but are they more skilled in specific situations? I'm not sure, but I feel that the specific skills should be better clarified for this particular study.*

### Chapter 2 - How to Use the Basic Secret for Influencing Others

"...You can injure a man physically, you can steal his goods, you can damage him in all sorts of ways, and get by with it. But the one unforgivable sin, as far as human relations are concerned, is to trample on another person's ego. The minute you detract from another's dignity as a human being, you are in for trouble."

Ego can be defined in various ways, but the author defines it as the "something deep in the heart of every man and woman that is important and demands respect."

Since we are all so unique, we want to maintain who we are and defense that importance against others.

***key tip: you automatically practice good human relations if you would remember that every individual is important..."

#### Four Facts of Life from the book:
1. We are all egotists.
1. We are all more interested in ourselves than in anything else in the world.
1. Every person you meet wants to feel important, and to "amount to something."
1. There is a craving in every human being for the approval of others, so they we can approve of ourselves.

It's only once our ego hunger is satisfied that we can give our attention properly to others.

#### What makes people self-centered and conceited?

In the past, the way people were "cured" of thinking too highly of themself was to "show him up" or "beat him down" and "knock some of his self-importance out of him." These tactics typically failed, because it's now known those suffering from being too self-centered isn't because they have too much self-esteem, but because they have too little.

"If you're on good terms with yourself you're on good terms with others...Once he gets over his painful dissatisfaction with himself, he is less critical and more tolerant of others"

Since Nature has put an instinct in all of us that says "YOU and your basic needs come first", the book uses the metaphor of a hungry stomach to show why those with hungry egos are more irritable. When someone has three meals a day, they don't think much about being hungry or about their stomach, but as soon as you begin missing meals, you become HANGRY. All you can think about is food and how your stomach needs it. You wouldn't say you are stomach-centeredness and you need to stop thinking about it, instead you would say eat :D. The same for ego-hunger!

#### LS/MFT - Low Self-Esteem Means Friction and Trouble

People with high (not extreme but comfortable high) are:
- easy to get along with
- cheerful, tolerant, willing to listen to others
- generous
- Willing to take a few risks
- Can afford to make mistakes and admit them
- Can be criticized and slighted, taking it in stride

They can be these things since their own needs are already taken care of.

He even mentions that to become petty, you must lower your own standards to the level of pettiness instead of just taking the high road. As Charlie Munger says: "Take the high road, it's uncrowded."

It's easier to understand the bully or people who "put you in your place" when you think of it with two things in mind:
1. They need to desperately increase their own self-importance, by beating you down, he is attempting to do so
1. They are afraid because with low self-esteem, one good "take-down" can deplete it altogether

It's difficult to talk face-to-face on an equal basis because it's risky. By keeping these points in mind, you can avoid cutting others down or being sarcastic, because by "winning" arguments you only decrease their self-esteem more and makes it harder to get along with them in the long run.

#### How to turn a lion into a lamb

"There is only one effective way to deal with trouble-makers: Help the other fellow like himself better"

The author isn't talking about insincere, fake flattery, but actual genuine compliments and praise. 

*First Law of Human Relations Summarize:*

"People act - or failt to act - largely to enhance their own egos."

Using Reason that will enhance the ego - it can work on anyone:

The book goes into a story of General Oglethorpe wanting permission from the King of England to found a colony in the New World. His logical arguments on the King were not working, so instead he tried to appeal to his ego with the following:

> Oglethorpe started out trying to sell the idea of what a fine thing it would be for England to have a colony in the New World - what a glorius thing it would be to plant the English flag in new territory.

> "But we already have colonies in the New World," said the King.

> "True, Sire," said Olgethorpe, "but none of them is named for you"

> The King sat up and took notice. He not only gave permission to settle the new colony named George, he financed the whole thing and even helped to populate it by setting scot-free debtors who owed money to the Crown."
