As the first month of the new year ends, I've made the decision to begin making my book notes public so others can potentially benefit from them if they so choose to.

I picked up a new book recently, [How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing with People](https://www.amazon.com/Have-Confidence-Power-Dealing-People/dp/0988727536), which is an interesting read when comparing and contrasting with the principles from the famous [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034).

## The Book Structure

Les Giblin structures the books into six main parts:
1. Making Human Nature Work For You
1. How to Control the Actions and Attitudes of Others
1. Techniques for Making and Keeping Friends
1. How to Manage People Successfully
1. A Simple, Effective Plan of Actions That Will Bring You Success and Happiness

I'll be diving into each part, along with individual chapters to summarize and highlight important points to take away.
