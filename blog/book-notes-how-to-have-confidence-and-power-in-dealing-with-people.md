As the first month of the new year ends, I've made the decision to begin making my book notes public so others can potentially benefit from them if they so choose to.

I picked up a new book recently, [How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing with People](https://www.amazon.com/Have-Confidence-Power-Dealing-People/dp/0988727536), which is an interesting read when comparing and contrasting with the principles from the famous [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034).

## The Book Structure

Les Giblin structures the books into six main parts:
1. Making Human Nature Work For You
1. How to Control the Actions and Attitudes of Others
1. Techniques for Making and Keeping Friends
1. How to Manage People Successfully
1. A Simple, Effective Plan of Actions That Will Bring You Success and Happiness

I'll be diving into each part, along with individual chapters to summarize and highlight important points to take away.

Before chapter one starts though, the book shows just what reading this book can do for you.

## What This Book Can Do For You

The introduction demonstrates the honest truth that "we want things from other people. We want other people's good will and friendship. We want their acceptance and recognition...."Every normal human being wants success and happiness"

Part of our happiness and success actually depends on others, because how we interact with them makes a huge difference in our own success. By understanding human nature better and being honest that we need things from others, and they need things from us, we can grow our skillset in finding win-win situations through our interactions with them. Here's a quote that summarize this:

"Let's get one thing straight: successful human relations means giving the other fellow something he wants in return for something you want. Any other method of dealing with people simply doesn't work."

In summary, by understanding that you have skills and assets give in exchange for skills or assets of others, you can find ways to give people what they want or need in exchange for what you want or need. This fair exchange is the best way to dealing with people in a positive way!

The rest of the book will be helping to determine how we can do this better, on the basis of knowing more about human nature and using it confidently.

## Part One - Making Human Nature Work For You

We all have developed ways for getting along with others, from being aggressive, assertive, passive, or somewhere in between. We go through the world with our mental model without issue, but that doesn't mean it will bring us personal satisfaction and properly manage the ego of those we're dealing with. Both parties should exit with egos intact - that is the key ladies and gentlemen!

When you take a step back and analyze who the most successful people you know are, what traits do you think of? Are they the smartest or most skillful? "...the chances are that you will say that the people you know who are most successful, and enjoy life the most, are those who "have a way" with other people.

**Personality Problems**

When we are shy, timid, extroverted, confident, or bossy - people are just trying to be accepted. They quickly learn though that you can't force friendship or acceptance, and when we try, our emotional health suffers. 

"Bonaro Overstreet,..., says that disruptive emotional problems always have their root in our relations with other people." 

Learning to better engage others helps our emotional health as well as our success!

**Social Skills in Engineers Literally Pays**

Purdue kept records of its Engineer graduates over ~5 years to determine which skills led to higher pay:

"When the earnings of those graduates who had demonstrated a marked ability to deal with others in social situations were compared, it was found that they averaged about 15 percent more than those of the "smart" group, and about 33 percent more than those with low personality rating."

*The study shows personality matter, but I couldn't find the exact study. What social skills did they look for? How did they determine someone's level of social skills? I say this because there are varying levels of social skills and in a world where Extroverts have typically been seen as having social skills, we should not confuse that with specific social skills on the job. Yes extroverts may be more social, but are they more skilled in specific situations? I'm not sure, but I feel that the specific skills should be better clarified for this particular study.*
