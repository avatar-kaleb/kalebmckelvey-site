As I conclude the day, there has been something quite funny on my mind that I wanted to share. We have two different types of friends. Those who read the random articles we send them, and those who don't!!
    
    
_Before starting into what I mean by this rambunctious claim, I want to disclaim that either type can still be great friends. All I'm saying is that there are these two types._
    

## Part 1 - Inspire others (including your friends)!

Now, to get things started. 

If you're anything like me, you have sites you follow: Lifehacker, Wired, Engadget, JoshuaKennon, Mr Money Mustache, etc. You also have news sites with articles to help us keep up (or try to) with what is going on in the world. 

Every once in awhile, I will find an article that I BELIEVE is truly worth taking the time to read. I quickly send the link over to my group chat or friends that I feel like could really benefit from reading it too, only to find out some (most) never read it.  Womp womp... 

Actually, I think this is one of the best lessons we can learn early in our life. 

It doesn't really matter if they read it, what matters is you're trying to give your interests, your passion, and your knowledge to others. Why? To make them better!! 

Nia once told me for my blog, it doesn't matter how many people you inspire, as long as you are inspiring someone. 

SO TRUE. 

What's really great about this is that, when you start sending articles around, people start sending them to you. Guess which group I'm in? Yes the one who reads them. 

Just today I read the "Uses of Great Men" essay by Ralph Emerson. I would definitely not have if someone great didn't send it to me. We do this pretty much every week back and forth, from personal growth to personal finance, or politics. 

Over time we have helped each other grow new knowledge and new perspective by providing a rich information diet. 

## Part 2 - Positive vs Negative Information Diets

With that being said, I want to move on to my second theory of the day. We have the power to dictate the energy we receive throughout the day. 

How? 

Think about this with me for one second. How many times did you check your phone or social media today? a gazillion? We are all avid checkers. It's fine and we can admit it. Have you admitted it? OK great. 

Next, think about your social media feed or news feed. Are you following sites or people that are giving you motivation? New perspectives? Positive vibes? 

Find great people in this world - Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Will Smith, Tony Robbins, or Stefan James. Follow positive quotes, personal finance blogs, and eating healthy feeds. Check out what they are doing. 

Life is a MARATHON, so each day begin increasing your positive energy levels with the positive feeds you read. It can truly make a difference! 

Final takeaway here, find people online that you want to be like. People others admire. People that are giving back to the world. And people that make an impact to you. In our program, Susan told us all to emulate the qualities we see in people at work we admire. By doing this, we begin to accumulate the traits we love about other people into ourselves. 

The same can be done on our daily feeds...continually adding the positive energy we want in our lives! 

### Concluding thoughts

It's been awhile since writing an article about the journey to achievement we are all on. Lewis Howes tweeted something (click below to take a look) that I will never forget today, and will always do in the future. 

A few weeks ago, he was in Guatemala building schools. Tony Robbins recently released a book to help improve the financial lives of millions, while feeding even more. There are great people all around us. We have the most access to them ever thanks to technology. Its up to all of us to use it as we go on to achieve !

I appreciate you for reading and have a great rest of the week!! 

Best Wishes,
