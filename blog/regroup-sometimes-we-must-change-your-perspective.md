## Positive Thinking is hard!

Ever had a week or two weeks or months that you felt like you took a step back on your positive thinking journey?

If not, kudos! If so, then no worries - me too.

If there is anyone who is hard on me, it's me. That's fine too because if all the chips fall down, guess what? I know I can count on me.

I hope that you believe the same because as previously posted, [everyone has a story](https://www.kalebmckelvey.com/blog/everyone-has-a-story-whats-yours-have-conversations-deeper-than-small-talk).

Everyone went through ups and downs to get where they are, and I sincerely believe that it is the moment we "get through" the downs we realize just how much we've grown while doing so. Just like hardships, sometimes journeys slow down or as a mentor of mine would say "you hit reflective walls." With the end goal in mind, we can ADAPT, get up, and CONTINUE FORWARD! Sometimes positive thinking is hard. It really can be, and so can life, so let us accept it and move forward.

Say it with me: "I have not moved as far forward as I wanted to this week, and I will do better starting tomorrow." There we go, now we're back on track. Let's take a moment to talk through a few blessings we have today:

1. Family
2. Friends
3. Food (especially Mediterranean since it's my new kick)
4. Water
5. Shelter
6. THE LIST GOES ON

Just like we all have stories, guess what? We all have blessings. Many of them!

By taking a second to think about them and realize how much we truly have, then how can we complain? Let's be grateful instead.

Thank you.

This is how we begin to regroup. Sometimes work is hard, sometimes we're tired, sometimes we stay up passed our optimal bedtime to write attempts at inspirational blogs, and sometimes our progress slips. It is all just part of the journey.

So what can we learn to help us continue our progress today?

## Improving by 1% per day

An article I read recently: [Being one Percent Better Every day](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/08/10/get-1-better-every-day-the-kaizen-way-to-self-improvement/) shows that with just 1% improvement a day for a year, we can become 38% better in a year.

I'll be honest - judging that is tough.

How can we improve by 1% per day? I'm not sure. I am sure of a few options we can do today to continue our journey through:

1. Read [http://www.positivelypositive.com](http://www.positivelypositive.com/)
2. Complete an act of kindness for someone (sincerely of course)
3. Learn something new (Article? Book? Hands-on?)
4. Modify/Reflect on positive thinking goals
5. Read our mantras

Easy enough right? Ever wished you could speak another language, or how to invest your money to prepare for the future? Me too - start to regroup and improve 1% today!!
