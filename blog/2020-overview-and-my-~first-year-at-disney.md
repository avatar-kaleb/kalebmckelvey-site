Thinking back to the first day of 2020, it feels unreal that I lived in a different apartment, worked at a different company, and commuted to Manhatten without a mask.

Early January brought with it the long-awaited on-site interviews I'd scheduled in mid-December because of the holidays. Additionally, I was hoping more would open up as new headcounts would open from a few companies that I passed the technical phone screening but didn't have available headcount at year end.

This meant that the grueling interview prep that started two months ago continued. Living in a studio apartment didn't make it easy; Frankie endured me waking up at 5:30 am, making a fresh cup of coffee, and working through Leet Code, AlgoExpert, or System Design practice questions every single day. 

I was near burn-out and hoped the upcoming interviews would go well!  Interviews are two-way streets, especially as you gain experience in what you like or dislike in a working environment.

Long interview story turned short, by the end of January I had accepted my new position as a Software Engineer working at Disney Streaming Services!!

Disney Plus had ~20 million subscribers a few months after launch, and I was ready and excited for my new opportunity!!
