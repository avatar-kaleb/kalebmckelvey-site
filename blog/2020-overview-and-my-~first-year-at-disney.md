Thinking back to the first day of 2020, it feels unreal that I lived in a different apartment, worked at a different company, and commuted to Manhatten without a mask.

Early January brought with it the long-awaited on-site interviews I'd scheduled in mid-December because of the holidays. Additionally, I was hoping more would open up as new headcounts would open from a few companies that I passed the technical phone screening but didn't have available headcount at year end.

This meant that the grueling interview prep that started two months ago continued. Living in a studio apartment didn't make it easy; Frankie endured me waking up at 5:30 am, making a fresh cup of coffee, and working through Leet Code, AlgoExpert, or System Design practice questions every single day. 

I was near burn-out and hoped the upcoming interviews would go well!  Interviews are two-way streets, especially as you gain experience in what makes you happy in a working environment; such as, product that you believe in, growth opportunities, culture, work-life balance, and respectful team members you'll be working with every single day are all important.

Long interview story turned short, by the end of January I had accepted my new position as a Software Engineer working at Disney Streaming Services!!

Disney Plus had ~20 million subscribers a few months after launch, and I was ready and excited for my new opportunity starting in February!!

Outside of interviews and job changes, we visited both Boston and Mexico in the first two months of 2020 - our timing was impeccable and unintentional. I'm thankful we stayed safe and we were able to get back home before travel bans had begun.

## The Pandemic Hits

February arrived slowly, my commute didn't change much and I hit the ground running with my new gig thanks to an awesome onboarding process. I'll never forget being in orientation, seeing all of the Disney swag, watching videos from Bob Iger about the company, inspirational videos with Disney characters, introducing the magical culture I'd now be part of.

I was just getting into the new routine, learning the new tech stack, and hitting the gym during lunch - all was going well...until one month in, we went from an in-person dev team to remote!

### The First Few Months

It really hit home we'd be working for a while as NYC cases surged and we began having lunch & learn sessions on how to work from home. Frankie was working from home soon after, and all of a sudden our studio apartment felt much, much smaller.

We were anxious and scared. Thankfully a friend had urged us a week or two prior to stock up on food and supplies, so at that moment we were fine. 

Reflecting though, at this time - there was much less knowledge from the scientific community about the virus, no one knew what was safe and what wasn't. We listened and watched the leadership of the nation, of NY, and of NYC on how we could stay safe and help out our fellow citizens

I remember following a few general principles:
1. Cloth masks were recommended, if you had other kinds donate them as supplies were limited
2. Only leave your apartment for necessities
3. Order from local restaurants to help them stay open
4. Donate to food banks and other organizations if you can, because we were in it together

Frankie and I both recall the unprecedented number of ambulance sirens throughout the day, it was non-stop and nerve wrecking, as Queens was hit hard at that time.

Every evening at 7:00pm(maybe it was 6?), we joined our fellow New Yorkers in clapping and making noise for our healthcare workers. It gave us a feeling of closeness to people we never met before. Friends and family worried about us as the virus hadn't hit other parts of the country as hard yet, but we assured them at the time we were safe.

For three months, we didn't leave our studio apartment. We wanted to do our part in stopping the spread and keep hospital beds available for others, so we constantly told ourselves we weren't stuck, but safe at home. Many artists and businesses entertained us through virtual means, and like others, we all appreciated it; because, almost all non-essential businesses were closed and big events had been canceled.

One humorous side was Frankie discovering how often Software Development teams collaborate (news flash, all day long), requiring close coordination as we avoided being on calls at the same time. 

### A Brief Summer

The summer brought with it a lapse in case numbers for New York; we left our apartment and even dined outside. We were able to sneak in two small beach trips, one in Long Beach and another in Montauk with a focus on outside activities.

I was ecstatic taking walks around our neighborhood parks, and I never appreciated seeing others doing the same (masks on most of the time) as much. It was a good feeling just being around other people, reminding us of how incredible living in NYC usually feels.

### Back to Cold Weather and Quarantine

It wasn't long though that warm weather turned chilly and cases spiked, leading us right back into the apartment except for essentials. Frankie joined a new team in the Fall, and with more meetings throughout both of our days, we decided it was moving time. Deciding on an apartment in September - we were all moved in and unpacked by the end of October.

Since then, life has been routine with home-cooked meals, work, video games, books, and occasional appointments such as visiting the dentist. 

We're doing our best as responsible citizens in a few ways:
1. Supporting local restaurants and businesses
1. Wearing masks
1. Reducing all travel
1. Relying on outside activities to prevent the spread
1. Donating to organizations that are helping people (hello Actors Fund!!)

It's been a different year to say the least, but we've been cognizant of our blessings and empathized with the hardships of others. There have been extreme difficulties and amazing silver linings, and we can only hope 2021 will be better for everyone!

Now that the mandatory Covid summary, here are some other parts of the year that could be of interest!

## My First Year at Disney

Working at Disney this year has been an absolutely blast. At time, I find it surreal playing a role in the ecosystem of a product used by at least 85 million people (and growing!!) that has helped bring happiness when the world has needed it. Watching Hamilton, The Mandalorian Season 2, Soul, and many others has brought nothing but joy.

### Delivering Happiness

Working on products that deliver goodness has been and will continue as part of my life mission. This year has been in tun with that perfectly; I love being part of something bigger than myself, and seeing the world respond has been an incredible experience.

It's been absolutely humbling and intriguing as I've been part of architecting and implementing many new features in the internal services I (along with our team) have the honor to support. There's nothing quite like finding solutions to challenging problems, weighing different architecture options, and celebrating the results built by the team!

There were many opportunities for personal growth, which I find highly rewarding! 

### Becoming More Versed in Angular & SpringBoot

During the interview, I learned that joining the team as a Full Stack engineer meant working on Angular, SpringBoot, and a relational DB.

The previous year at NM consisted of working on a React app with GraphQl...in other words, I was a bit rusty on the backend and didn't have much experience with Angular so far in my career. I gladly accepted the challenge!

#### Angular vs. React

Learning the large feature list of the Angular Framework was tough for me this year. I'll admit it grew on me as my experience level increased, and it's a solid framework. 

The biggest complaint I have with Angular is the various places logic can happen, for example, in the templates, in the component, or parts of angular like an auth guard or interceptor. It's amazing once you figure out what those are and how to quickly see where they are used, but in the beginning it's quite difficult - especially with the separation of things by module in one project. There are more standard ways of implementing common features of web applications these days that I do appreciate, and services as a way to share data across components works wonders with managing data in the app. Overall, I find it very useful for an enterprise application. 

React still has my final vote of preference (although not by much) with the beauty of combining JSX and component logic (especially now with hooks) in one place, especially with the huge win of opening less files while developing one component.

I find many that prefer Angular to use the argument of "separating html, JS/TS, and CSS" in their own files. I've mostly used `SCSS` in my React projects with separate files, so that boils it down to separating out HTML from JS.

It's a strong argument and separating concerns at face value makes sense. 

Once you start adding `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, attribute binding, property binding, custom events, and even the `<ng-container>` tags, it no longer feels like they are separate in my humble opinion. Instead, you now have HTML entangled with intertwined framework features (even if you keep template logic simple).

The huge win of having all implementations of common web app features in Angular, especially when it's supported by Google devs and OSS, is hugely beneficial. I'll never forget that feeling of changing from React Router to Reach Router, only to learn later that Reach Router would be deprecated and one should move back to React Router...when both were created and supported by the same people. 

It's hard to see that situation happening in Angular; and, that's why it has become such a close match for me that I'm fine using either, but vote subtlety for React if given the option.
