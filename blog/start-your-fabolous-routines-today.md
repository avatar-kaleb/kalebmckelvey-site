## Why do I find Fabulous Routines to be helpful?

### First:

Routines allow you remember to do small habits that make a big difference such as reading. 

### Second:

We as humans like to weigh our negative aspects of the day more heavily than positive. Taking time to routinely remind ourselves of the positives, we can flip the scale. 

### Third:

We are our daily habits. 

Every journey towards achievement begins with the first step, then the second, then the third, and continues on. If you want to learn more about the human body, then go to the library, check out a book, and read it for 20 minutes every day in your routine. 

What seems effortless, the book reaches the last page and you finally found the time to learn the body has 206 bones and 600+ muscles. 

### Last:

On those days we feel like accomplishments are lacking. We didn’t complete as much as we wanted. We weren’t productive. We can turn it around! 

In relevance to the ”[making your bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBQLFLei70)” concept the military uses, being able to have the will power to still complete your routines IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT! 

## OK Kaleb, Fabolous Routines are helpful. Now what?

Well if you’re a tech kind of person as I am (AKA nerd), then its APP TIME! *drum rolls* Introducing.......... _[Fabolous](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.thefabulous.app) (android only, IOS in development)_ 

“Fabulous is a science-based app, incubated in Duke's Behavioral Economics Lab, that will help you build healthy rituals into your life, just like an elite athlete.” 

This app has defined habits to create positive and healthier changes in your life. Drinking water, writing to do list, stretching, and more. Being scientifically backed, it gives itself credit to helping you grow to be better. 
I defined my own habits and own routines, while sometimes incorporating in theirs (like their stretching routine) to make a unique routine for my needs. Overall the app tracks how well you perform, showing you habits you tend to skip and offering wisdom on how to get back on track. 

### This looks great – what should I do next?

1. Take 15 minutes minutes this week to decide on 3 habits you want to start to make yourself be better. Examples: Floss, drink a cup of water, meditate, read, or write in your 5-minute journal, etc.

2. Download the app from the link above if you’re an Android user, if not visit their [site](http://www.thefabulous.co/) and sign up for a notification for IOS release. 

3. Create your routines in the app or decide to follow one of theirs. 

4. Enjoy yourself!! Starting a new habit is hard work. If you miss a day, no worries! Keep your head up! Routines help take our daily habits into life long growth. Reading daily grows knowledge. Exercising promotes physical health. Meditating gives our mind attention. As achievers, we want to grow from good to great. Start today and watch these small habits make a BIG difference in your life!! 

Please let me know if you have any questions in the comments. 

One Love,
