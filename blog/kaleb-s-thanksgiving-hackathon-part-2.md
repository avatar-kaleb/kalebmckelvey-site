Hard to believe it is already Sunday. I'm pretty excited to get back to Predix and Historian tomorrow, although it has been a great few days of Thanksgiving break. Two days ago, I began [my own Thanksgiving Hackathon](https://kalebmckelvey.com/kalebs-thanksgiving-hackathon-part-1) to progress on my InspireMe app. Today I want to show it went! First and foremost, please understand that I will be working to make the theming of the app better in the upcoming weeks. I focused on functionality for this weekend.

## Accomplishments of my Thanksgiving Hackathon:

  * Quotes page - discover segment loads list of random quotes FROM SQLite (not stubbed!!!) that can be favorited
    * favorite => add to favorite
    * dismiss => remove from the list, when list reaches 0, load more to Discover
  * Quotes page - favorite segment loads favorited quotes from the user
  * Quotes page - submit segment lets you submit a favorite quote via email
  * Schedule page - Quote can be scheduled
    * disclaimer - default configuration is used, not from the form in the screenshots (next step for sure)
  * Schedule page - notifications -> Local notifications are working and are using a quote from the database
  * Schedule page - scheduled notifications show as a list of cards, even if the formatting/user experience is terrible at the moment
  * SQLite - FINALLLLLLYY GOT THIS WORKING TO LOAD INITIAL QUOTES!!!

## Next steps:

  * Finish up functionality
  * Clean up code
  * Theme the app and get logos/icons made
  * Write Test code

## Screenshots from my Thanksgiving Hackathon:

I uploaded the screenshots into my portfolio, check out Inspir3Me here:

### Lessons:

  1. Have your development environment updated and set up before starting
  2. Buy more snacks!!
  3. Enjoy the process
  4. Drink lots of coffee
  5. Put your head under a cold shower when you start getting tired in the late night
  6. Take breaks (and read the Ranger's apprentice series if you haven't)

### Final thoughts:

My Thanksgiving Hackathon was a blast and for me considered a success!!Â 

I will be looking to optimize the code a bit as the language becomes more familiar. Snacks, totally gone. I will never forget bagel bites again.

Lastly, thanks to everyone who gave me some quotes to use on Facebook, all of them were included in the prototype.

Have a great Sunday!!
