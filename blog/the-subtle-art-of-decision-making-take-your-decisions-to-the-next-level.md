Last week I had the honor of speaking at the [Impact Labs Fellowship Summit](https://www.impactlabs.io/fellowship/) - "A 2-week technical fellowship for the next generation of social entrepreneurs."

Thankfully the organizers allowed me to speak on a topic that has been of interest to me as of late - decision making!

I see decision making and communication in our lives in a similar domain, because although we do each every single day, we aren't actually very good at either. 

Last year and continuing into this year, I've been reading books on the topic (see resources below if you are interested) to compile a list of findings to make better decisions in my life. This blog is going to be a live document (so to speak) as I state my findings and also my evolving decision making process going forward - I hope you find it helpful as well!
