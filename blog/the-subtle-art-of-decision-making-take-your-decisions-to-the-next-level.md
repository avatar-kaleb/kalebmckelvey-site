Last week I had the honor of speaking at the [Impact Labs Fellowship Summit](https://www.impactlabs.io/fellowship/) - "A 2-week technical fellowship for the next generation of social entrepreneurs."

Thankfully the organizers allowed me to speak on a topic that has been of interest to me as of late - decision making!

I see decision making and communication in our lives in a similar domain, because although we do each every single day, we aren't actually very good at either. 

Last year and continuing into this year, I've been reading books on the topic (see resources below if you are interested) to compile a list of findings to make better decisions in my life. This article is going to be a live document (so to speak) as I share my evolving decision making process - I hope you find it helpful as well!

## We Make a TON of Decisions Every Day

The number of decisions we make per day has been stated as **35,000**, or two decisions per second. For those who have me the current life expectancy within the US (~78), you have made a total of **996,450,000** decisions in your life so far. The 35K per day number has been cited in multiple places, although I can't find the original study that proves it - the difficulty of measuring decisions is quite challenging.

Even so, it's obvious in my humble opinion that we do make a large number of decisions every single day.
- What should I eat for breakfast?
- One egg or two?
- Scrambled or Sunny-side up?
- How long should it cook? 
- How much oil to put in the pan?
- Which pan to use?
- Do I want coffee or orange juice?
- Which cup do I want to use?
- How much should I fill the cup?
- Sugar or milk in the coffee?
...
and you get the idea.

These are easy decisions, imagine making a decision of higher difficulty and ambiguity throughout the day as well. 

- Which task is most important to work on?
- Do I feel like doing this task?
- How should I design my components to implement this feature?
- What would Wes Bos, Kent Dodds, or Dan Abranov do if they were designing it?
- What should the names be?
- Is it conveying meaning for the next dev well?
- Is this code structured in a way that can easily be digested?
- and....more and more.. :D
