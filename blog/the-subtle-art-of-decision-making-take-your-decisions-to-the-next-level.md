Last week I had the honor of speaking at the [Impact Labs Fellowship Summit](https://www.impactlabs.io/fellowship/) - "A 2-week technical fellowship for the next generation of social entrepreneurs."

Thankfully the organizers allowed me to speak on a topic that has been of interest to me as of late - decision making!

I see decision making and communication in our lives in a similar domain, because although we do each every single day, we aren't actually very good at either. 

Last year and continuing into this year, I've been reading books on the topic (see resources below if you are interested) to compile a list of findings to make better decisions in my life. This article is going to be a live document (so to speak) as I share my evolving decision making process - I hope you find it helpful as well!

## We Make a TON of Decisions Every Day

The number of decisions we make per day has been stated as **35,000**, or two decisions per second. For those who have me the current life expectancy within the US (~78), you have made a total of **996,450,000** decisions in your life so far. The 35K per day number has been cited in multiple places, although I can't find the original study that proves it - the difficulty of measuring decisions is quite challenging.

Even so, it's obvious in my humble opinion that we do make a large number of decisions every single day.
- What should I eat for breakfast?
- One egg or two?
- Scrambled or Sunny-side up?
- How long should it cook? 
- How much oil to put in the pan?
- Which pan to use?
- Do I want coffee or orange juice?
- Which cup do I want to use?
- How much should I fill the cup?
- Sugar or milk in the coffee?
...
and you get the idea.

These are easy decisions, imagine making a decision of higher difficulty and ambiguity throughout the day as well. 

- Which task is most important to work on?
- Do I feel like doing this task?
- How should I design my components to implement this feature?
- What would Wes B, Kent D, or Dan A do if they were designing it?
- What should the names of my components be?
- Are the names conveying meaning for the next dev well?
- Is this code structured in a way that can easily be digested?
- and....more and more.. :D

## Making Smart Decisions Matters

With so many decisions being made in a life-time, it only makes sense that we should try to make sure we are making them properly right?

[Joshua Kennon](https://www.kalebmckelvey.com/insights-from-reading-769-joshua-kennon-blog-posts) has written about the fact we are the sum of all the decisions we've previously made. 

*Think about it. Think about the decisions you've made that landed where you are today. The city in which you live, the job you currently have, the friends you've met along the way. So many of the smaller decisions have had a butterfly effect on your life, mine too!*

Here's an example:

I decided to go to James Madison University and pay for it myself over going to community college for two years then transferring. Because of this, I had two suite-mates from Richmond, VA who introduced me to the multi-cultural center and events on campus. I went to as many as I could, the community was wonderful! This led me to eventually join Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc, where I was encouraged my Senior year to attend a leadership institute they offer that was sponsored by General Electric. I applied early and was accepted into the conference. After attending the conference, I was reached out to by a conference organizer who asked me to apply for GE's leadership program. I was eventually hired and had many experiences with amazing people that changed my life!

**TLDR:**

Because I decided to go to JMU, I joined my fraternity which led to attending a conference sponsored by GE. I was asked to apply to GE's leadership program and was hired, leading to many amazing experiences with amazing people!

Decisions we make lead to real consequences in our life, good, bad, and in-between. Doing our best to make the big decisions wisely can lead us through the correct paths as we make our journeys to achieve!
