Bookclub! Did someone say bookclub? 

A colleague and I have decided to co-lead a technical genre bookclub! We're both really excited about it because, let's be honest, it's difficult to read tech books on your own without some extra motivation. 

The discussions are a great way to really learn from and teach each other along the way too! I want to take these discussions and reading the book even further by passing on the knowledge to you!

*JavaScript: the Good Parts by Douglas Crockford* was decided on as our first book choice. It isn't a full manual or walkthrough of every feature in JS, but gives an overview of the parts the author believes are best. 

The book is a bit outdated, so in this series, I'm going to try my best to both give summaries of each chapter and add commentary to newer features within the language. Further, I will be creating Code Pens to show examples and solidify learning of each concept that deems worthy.

Lastly - there is debate on good parts and bad parts of the JavaScript language. I will do my best to show when giving my own opinion versus summarizing the book. 

Let us begin!

## Chapter 1. Good Parts:

When we decide on using a programming language, we have many options on how to implement features and requirements at our disposal. Douglas C states that when he was less experienced as a programmer, he had a habit of using all features, good or bad, and that caused some tricky or error-prone code. We should only use good parts instead.

> "Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts. I discovered that I could be a better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts"

### A Small History of JS

JavaScript was created in 10 days ([or was it?](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-10-day-programming-language-is-a-myth/)) and had no time to be functionally tested to rid itself of bad parts. It was necessary to get the new language out to compete with other languages at the time, and Netscape Navigator 2 wanted to win that browser war.

Winning over Java Applets, JS became the language of the web and is now used more widely today (IOT, web, and servers - who would have thought?).

Mr. Crockford argues that since the language was so little tested and rushed out, it was released with some bad parts. Unfortunately, those bad parts could not be taken out because sites in the wild still use them. Languages can be updated, but taking out the bad parts isn't an easy task.

> "Perhaps the greatest benefit of studying the good parts is that you can avoid the need to unlearn the bad parts. Unlearning bad patterns is very difficult.
