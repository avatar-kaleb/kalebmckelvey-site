    value: `Many positives are commonly mentioned about
    relationships - support, love, friendship, and more - while one I
    believe is left out. That one thing? The amount you grow and learn
    about your own character, helping you to become not only a better
    partner but a better individual too!`

    title: 'Doing Something Lessons',
    value: `Sometimes just doing something before you
    actually have the full plan ready results in better focus to grow
    the plan, or fail fast on a project you don't
    actually enjoy - meaning you don't spend a bunch of time planning
    for something you find out you dislike.`

    value: `The person you are, the success you bring or
    happiness you have doesn't come in spikes. Instead, they are like
    compound interest, gradually growing into the high levels you
    eventually see. This gives more reason to not procrastinate, but
    break down big tasks into smaller daily ones (like do 1 hour of
    training a day vs 4 on Friday) to achieve our goals.`

    value: `People in your life can tell you how much they respect you, care about you, appreciate you, etc. These declarations are great and an important part of relationships, yet it is always the actions that either dispel or backup these statements that truly matter.`

    value:
      'You can always do more to increase the amount of money you have in bank accounts, but there is an account that decreases every second. Your time balance. There is nothing more important than giving the people you love in your life some of those ticking seconds.'

    title: 'Measurements in Your Life',
    value:
      'We each use different measurements for other people in our life, friendships or spouses as we want to have balance within those relationships. One key point to remember? You can’t control others and if they don’t have the same measurements in place – you may end up disappointed. Communicate those expectations if necessary, or accept them for who they are. The boundary should be of their character, not the measurements of their contact or other expectations you set on them.'

    title: 'Social Media Doesn’t Paint the Truth',
    value:
      "Taking a peek at someone’s social media accounts as an indicator of their life doesn’t work. People post in different ways, only show specific information, and there isn't a true connection in a page visit. Real friendships are those who catch up through face to face or phone calls that produce intimate conversations to build trust. There is no other way."

      'Expertise is a fluid concept that doesn’t have defined expectations. In reality, most of the time, there is someone who has more expertise than you on a subject. Let them be and live your life in peace. Instead, do your best to get a little smarter, and a little wiser each day.'

    value:
      'Mistakes are going to happen in your life, there is no mistaking that. Decide where you want to be at the end of your life and start using inversion to see which actions take you there. For each action, ask yourself – what would be detrimintal to reaching these goals….avoid them like the plague, or bitcoin.'

    value:
      'During the most memorable experiences in your life, no one remembers what you were wearing, what size watch you were wearing, or what brand of shoes you have on. They remember how they felt, who they were with, and the new experience they never had before!'

    title: 'Journey Before Destination',
    value:
      '“The most important words a man can say are, “I will do better.” These are not the most important words any man can say. I am a man, and they are what I needed to say. The ancient code of the Knights Radiant says “journey before destination.” Some may call it a simple platitude, but it is far more. A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one." -Brandon Sanderson Oathbringer'

    title: 'You Get the Respect You Demand',
    value: `We're taught at a young age, be assertive - not agressive or passive. This is a tough balance in the fast world we live in, because
    people know more than we do in certain topics. People have authority and we have authority bias towards those in leadership roles. I believe
    that being assertive is a powerful talent, one that should be exercised to bring yourself the respect you deserve while being very respectful
    to others. It's a balance of both getting/demanding respect in a respectful way that helps you in all areas of your life.`

     Unhappy at your job? Find a way to change what is making you unhappy or find a new job. 
     Unhappy with your commute? Find a new apartment. 
     Easy to say harder to do right? Life isn't easy and we must use grit to get through the challenges!`
