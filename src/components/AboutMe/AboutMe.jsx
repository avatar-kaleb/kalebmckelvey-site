        <p>
          I graduated from GE&apos;s Digital Technology Leadership Program in February 2017. From

          initiatives, improveed our code base with every new feature, and helped architect designs
          to meet requirements from our Product Owners.
          <br />

        {/* Story! */}
        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>
          I believe everyone has a wonderful story to explain how in the world they got to the
          current moment we call now. Here&#39;s a bit of mine!
        </p>
        <h2>TLDR:</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;m Kaleb McKelvey, a small town raised young professional, who focuses on exhibiting
          high character combined with strong ambition to continously grow a little bit each day.
          <br />
          <br />
          I began my career working as a Jr AX Dynamics developer at Shentel, transitioned to a
          leadership program at GE Healthcare which led to becoming a Staff Software Engineer; Since
          then, I made the move to a new industry and city - New York - to close the distance with
          my girlfriend and take on a new role!
          <br />
          <br />
          My experiences in leadership and technical depth, has molded me into a well rounded
          Software Engineer who has a true passion for technology!
        </p>
        <h2>Long Version</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a young professional with aspirations to inspire, grow, and achieve in various
          areas of my life.
        </p>
        <h3>Small town life</h3>
        <p>Growing up in a small town built the foundation of who I am today in a few ways.</p>
        <p>
          First, and most important, my family instilled in me the values of responsibility,
          character, and integrity.  Second, my coaches and teachers taught me the values of work
          ethic and accountability. Lastly, it gave me the opportunity to understand that boredom
          can be replaced with canoe trips down the river, swimming in the quarry, and learning new
          technologies!
        </p>
        <h3>College Years</h3>
        <p>
          Technology for me began with video games, leading to a desire for becoming a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this desire that my college journey began, a journey that changed my perspective by
          opening my mind and meeting great people with unique stories. A place to learn how to
          develop software from experts and the skill of time management through balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          By graduation, I completed my dream of learning to develop and became a member of the
          greatest fraternity in the world, Kappa Alpha Psi.
        </p>
        <p>
          My family, fraternity brothers, and colleagues guided me to a new vision on life, one that
          looks at the future as much as the present.
        </p>
        <h3>Becoming a Software Engineer!</h3>
        <p>
          Since then, I began working at GE in their Digital Technology Leadership Program followed
          achieving my dream of becoming a Software Engineer! GE is a company that focuses on the
          development of both technical and leadership skill-sets. Because of this, I have grown in
          both my professional and personal worlds thanks to the fabulous people I&apos;ve met on
          the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward today, I work at Northwestern Mutual - a company that has more than a century
          under its belt -&nbsp; adventuring through a digital transformation. Personal finance has
          long been a passion of mine, so getting an opportunity to spend 40+ hours a week
          developing software to help people with that area of their life has been great!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only do I get to do this while taking on the new experiences NYC has to offer, but I
          get to do it with my best friend supporting me through the journey!
        </p>
        <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Overall I am excited to grow through new experiences! My passion for technology and desire
          to make the world a better place drives me to continue learning. Life is a feeling process
          and a journey to achieve all that you want on the way!
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to influence your journey towards achieving anything you want. I truly believe you
          are the executive of your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all that being said, I look forward to hearing from you - comment, subscribe, and
          enjoy!
        </p>
        <p>
          Best wishes,
          <br />
