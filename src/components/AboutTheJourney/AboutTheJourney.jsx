        <h2>Knighthood</h2>
        <p>
          In the medieval days, knighthood was the noble honor to serve one&apos;s king in exchange
          for property and status within the kingdom. Knights dedicated their life&apos;s younger
          years to training, so they could prove themselves worthy to achieve the noble title. A
          knight must follow the knight&apos;s code of conduct, or Chivalry.
        </p>
        <p>
          This romanticized code came late into the history of knights, requiring them to
          demonstrateÂ  respect for the honor of women, defending those of less status, and working
          for the welfare of others. Overall, they were expected to live up to their entitled
          &quot;Sir&quot; title.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to 2017, although feudalism has died off (good riddance), the values we
          uphold greatly impacts our future. The character traits we choose to uphold into our value
          system holds more weight than how people perceive us. Character is more important than
          image in the perspective of achievement, because{' '}
          <strong>
            it is who you are, not who people think you are, which grants opportunities in your
            life.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Achievement</h2>
        <p>
          In our days since medieval times, many of these codes have been changed along with the
          definition of success.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my humble opinion, life is less about success in terms of money, but achieving in
          making a positive impact on our world. Achievement represents the opportunity to give back
          to others, develop strong relationships with the people you care about, and spend time in
          accordance to your purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a brother of Kappa Alpha Psi, Fraternity, I hope to live by our motto of
          &quot;Achievement in Every Field of Human Endeavor,&quot; as it guides us well.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s truly because of the experiences gained from the brotherhood, that I have
          developed the right mindset to continuously achieve on my own journey. By incorporating
          our fraternity values - in addition to modern day principles - we can become the person we
          aspire to be.
        </p>
        <h2>The Journey to Achieve</h2>
        <p>The journey represents a marathon versus a sprint in your life.</p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s the process of making mistakes, growing from them, and become wiser each day.
          It&apos;s creating the life you want. How? By being your own executive when making
          decisions that traverse life&apos;s unknown path. It&apos;s learning to achieve
          vicariously from great role models in our life like - Charlie Munger, Stephen Covey, or
          Will Smith - to incorporate life principles or proven mental models when making decisions.
          Lastly, its learning to think independently by focusing on the process leading your life
          towards achievement! Join me in your journey to achieve!
